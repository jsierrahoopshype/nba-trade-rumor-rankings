2025-11-28,Ariel Hukporti,,,"On the current roster, who is the most likely player to be traded by this season’s trade deadline? — Geoffrey R. Talking to people in the league as of late, the name I keep hearing most is 20-year-old Pacôme Dadiet. I’ve gathered that the Knicks are entering camp with the idea of keeping Brogdon and Shamet, both of whom are on non-guaranteed deals, for the regular-season roster. That could change depending on how they perform, but that’s the vibe I’ve gotten. To keep both, the Knicks would have to make a trade. Given Dadiet’s age, size (6-8, 210) and projected profile if his development shakes out, he has more value around the league than the likes of youngsters Tyler Kolek or Ariel Hukporti, according to people I’ve spoken with. That is why if the Knicks want to make room for the two veterans, trading Dadiet makes the most sense. I can’t imagine it would be for more than a second-round pick, but some league executives I’ve spoken with think his value is higher than that of Kolek or Hukporti.

And part of me believes the reason he didn’t go full bore into the trade demand this summer — where he sort of sat around and didn’t make noise about it in June and July and didn’t make a move until the August — was because he knew that he would have much more control next year. And so if that happens, then you’re looking at a team like Golden State or a team like New York who could leverage Giannis’ desire to be in a big market — which I think is going to be a factor.” YouTube Golden State Warriors , Milwaukee Bucks , New York Knicks , Trade , Giannis Antetokounmpo",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9j_0rxmA7DY,"Brian Windhorst: Most importantly, after this season, Giannis only has one year on his contract.

When the Knicks gave small forward Mikal Bridges a four-year, $150 million extension in late July, that meant he couldn’t be traded for six months. That matters a great deal because any Bucks-Knicks deal for Giannis Antetokounmpo, however unlikely, would have to be focused on actual players as opposed to draft assets because the Knicks don’t have much to offer on that front (largely because of the deal they did to land Bridges from Brooklyn in July 2024 and the deal with Minnesota for Karl-Anthony Towns three months later).

When you go through all third all 29 teams, you basically eliminate them, and then it's a small amount here. I did have one team say, we asked about what a return would look like if Morant was ever traded.

Clippers that involved another four players, including 16-year veteran Patty Mills. Because Mills was in the last season of his contract, league rules required his agent to attest that no future contract with the team trading him had been agreed to under the table. There was just one issue, Weitzman reports: Mills’ agent, Steven Heumann, was observing Shabbat and therefore offline. “This meant that all parties had to wait until an hour after sundown on Saturday night,” Weitzman writes. “In the meantime, Pelinka and Harrison [the respective general managers of the Lakers and Mavericks] agreed to keep the details quiet. Neither side wanted to risk anything leaking.” What if something had leaked? It’s possible and maybe likely that the deal would have fallen apart. Mavericks fans would have rioted — perhaps literally — to stop a trade. Competing offers might have come in from other teams. Or Doncic’s agent might have tried to force him to a different destination. But the gag order held, and the next Laker dynasty began. Ironically, Heumann (who did not immediately respond to an inquiry), wouldn’t have known that he was holding up The Luka freaking Doncic Trade even after Shabbat, because none of the adjacent teams or players or agents was wise to the NBA earthquake they were facilitating. Instead, his observance inverted an experience many Jews are familiar with — the excruciating wait for Shabbat to end so you can start working — by giving it to non-Jews.

When the Knicks gave small forward Mikal Bridges a four-year, $150 million extension in late July, that meant he couldn’t be traded for six months. That matters a great deal because any Bucks-Knicks deal for Giannis Antetokounmpo, however unlikely, would have to be focused on actual players as opposed to draft assets because the Knicks don’t have much to offer on that front (largely because of the deal they did to land Bridges from Brooklyn in July 2024 and the deal with Minnesota for Karl-Anthony Towns three months later).

For salary cap reasons, they needed to complete a separate trade with the Utah Jazz — and before the Jazz could accept, they needed to do a trade with the L.A. Clippers that involved another four players, including 16-year veteran Patty Mills. Because Mills was in the last season of his contract, league rules required his agent to attest that no future contract with the team trading him had been agreed to under the table. There was just one issue, Weitzman reports: Mills’ agent, Steven Heumann, was observing Shabbat and therefore offline. “This meant that all parties had to wait until an hour after sundown on Saturday night,” Weitzman writes. “In the meantime, Pelinka and Harrison [the respective general managers of the Lakers and Mavericks] agreed to keep the details quiet. Neither side wanted to risk anything leaking.” What if something had leaked? It’s possible and maybe likely that the deal would have fallen apart. Mavericks fans would have rioted — perhaps literally — to stop a trade. Competing offers might have come in from other teams. Or Doncic’s agent might have tried to force him to a different destination. But the gag order held, and the next Laker dynasty began. Ironically, Heumann (who did not immediately respond to an inquiry), wouldn’t have known that he was holding up The Luka freaking Doncic Trade even after Shabbat, because none of the adjacent teams or players or agents was wise to the NBA earthquake they were facilitating.

2025-11-28,PLAYER,,,"On the current roster, who is the most likely player to be traded by this season’s trade deadline? — Geoffrey R. Talking to people in the league as of late, the name I keep hearing most is 20-year-old Pacôme Dadiet. I’ve gathered that the Knicks are entering camp with the idea of keeping Brogdon and Shamet, both of whom are on non-guaranteed deals, for the regular-season roster. That could change depending on how they perform, but that’s the vibe I’ve gotten. To keep both, the Knicks would have to make a trade. Given Dadiet’s age, size (6-8, 210) and projected profile if his development shakes out, he has more value around the league than the likes of youngsters Tyler Kolek or Ariel Hukporti, according to people I’ve spoken with. That is why if the Knicks want to make room for the two veterans, trading Dadiet makes the most sense. I can’t imagine it would be for more than a second-round pick, but some league executives I’ve spoken with think his value is higher than that of Kolek or Hukporti.

That could change depending on how they perform, but that’s the vibe I’ve gotten. To keep both, the Knicks would have to make a trade. Given Dadiet’s age, size (6-8, 210) and projected profile if his development shakes out, he has more value around the league than the likes of youngsters Tyler Kolek or Ariel Hukporti, according to people I’ve spoken with. That is why if the Knicks want to make room for the two veterans, trading Dadiet makes the most sense.

2025-11-28,Victor Wembanyama,,,"As mentioned earlier, the 2025-26 and 2026-27 seasons are the best window for the Spurs to make a big move. That’s because they have more flexibility under the first apron and fewer restrictions in transactions. For example, they can take back more salaries than they’re sending out in a trade. That might not be the case once both Fox and Wembanyama are on maximum contracts.

2025-11-28,Victor Wembanyama,,,"Kevin O’Connor: “Victor Wembanyama and De’Aaron Fox aren’t going to be as potent as they should be able to be on paper with Fox’s speed and downhill attacking and Victor being the alien that he is. Those guys should be one of the best combinations in the league. I don’t think the roster around them is quite exactly what it needs to be for them to reach their potential. That’s where a trade's going to have to come in at some point this year or next summer. The upside is obvious — Fox collapses defenses, and Wemby’s gravity on the pop or roll stretches the floor vertically and horizontally. But when you surround them with shaky shooters or young guys still figuring it out, all that potential just clogs up.” YouTube San Antonio Spurs , Trade , De'Aaron Fox , Victor Wembanyama",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xp5oBlUZUIA&t=465s,Kevin O’Connor: “Victor Wembanyama and De’Aaron Fox aren’t going to be as potent as they should be able to be on paper with Fox’s speed and

However, nothing is imminent as Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo nears a return from a low-grade adductor strain. Should Milwaukee’s interest in LaVine become more serious, it’s worth noting that Bucks forward Kyle Kuzma and Kings Governor Vivek Ranadive both invested in a new women’s professional sports venture called Major League Volleyball, and Kuzma has been linked to the Kings via trade rumors for several seasons.

2025-11-28,Zion Williamson,,,"Kevin O’Connor: “With Zion, he has three years left on his deal — $39, $42, $45 million in the final three years of that deal. It's not untradable, but when you think about the teams that would want to do it, it's either a team that's desperate — where there's nobody else out there — a team that feels like this is our best option, our only option to try to optimize our chances at a championship, or it's a team kind of like you where like you're — you're wandering a bit. You don't actually have an identity. You're figuring things out and you're like, 'I'll try this pair of pants on and see how it fits.' That's what it could be with Zion if a deal actually happens. But if you're the — if you're the Pelicans, that's the difficulty with a Zion trade. What are you gonna get back for him at that point? Like, it might just be that it's worth just keeping him and hoping he stays healthy for 82 games some year and that things pan out.” YouTube New Orleans Pelicans , Trade , Zion Williamson",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xp5oBlUZUIA&t=965s,"Kevin O’Connor: “With Zion, he has three years left on his deal — $39, $42, $45 million in the final three years of that deal.
