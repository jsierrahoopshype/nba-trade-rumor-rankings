Anthony Davis,anthony-davis,2025-11-24T00:00:00,"The Dallas Mavericks are reportedly facing a conundrum when it comes to potentially trading star big man Anthony Davis. During Monday's episode of The Hoop Collective, ESPN's Tim Bontemps explained that Davis' trade value isn't as high as many would expect for a player of his caliber. ""The idea of trading Anthony Davis has everyone trained to think, well, they're gonna get three firsts, two swaps, they're gonna get two young players and they're gonna get all this stuff,"" Bontemps said around the 33:00 mark. ""I shouldn't say it's not gonna happen... but, you talk to people in the league, there's not a lot of teams that are lining up to take on a 35-year-old Anthony Davis making $63 million, and you have to assume that he's gonna opt into that deal.""

Malik Monk, who was part of the Jonathan Kuminga trade talks with Golden State in the summer that are likely to be revisited, has a combined $41.7 million on his deal in the next two seasons (including a 2027-28 player option). The list goes on from there, with fourth-year guard Keon Ellis ($2.3 million expiring deal) widely seen as one of the most coveted Kings players among rival teams.

LaMelo Ball,lamelo-ball,2025-11-24T00:00:00,"Marc Stein: The reality is, there’s chatter out there — a lot of curiosity, most of it coming from rival front offices. Are the Hornets going to be open to fielding trade pitches for LaMelo Ball? To this point — and this will sound a lot like the Ja Morant situation in Memphis — the messaging is that the Hornets don’t want to field those pitches. They don’t want to trade him . There was a report this week from my pal in Houston, Kelly Iko, writing for Yahoo Sports. Kelly wrote that Ball is open to a trade, and that the Hornets are disillusioned with him on various levels. Both parties have come out and publicly denied that — insisting it’s not the case. Again, we haven’t even gotten to Thanksgiving. Trade season doesn’t officially start until December 15th. As of where we are right now, the Hornets insist they’re not gauging Ball’s trade value.” YouTube",https://hoopshype.com/rumors/tag/trade/#g-rKG81

LaMelo Ball,lamelo-ball,2025-11-23T00:00:00,"LaMelo Ball is not a character concern off the floor by any means, to my understanding, even if sources say it's indeed true that he's been frustrated by the team's lack of forward progress. Ball has played in 47 or fewer games in each of the past three seasons due to injury. His shot selection also turns some teams off, but the durability questions resonate the loudest leaguewide. It's somewhat reminiscent of the situation Anthony Davis faces in Dallas. The Hornets are unlikely to get the sort of offers for Ball they'd be hoping for until their star guard can get through a stretch of sustained production, availability and ideally some winning. No wonder the Hornets, as league sources maintain, are not currently interested in looking to move him. marcstein.substack.com",https://hoopshype.com/rumors/tag/trade/#g-rKG6M

You may scoff at the idea, but the Knicks want to win a title this season. If Dallas is offering Davis at a below-market cost, I’m sure the Knicks will at least give the move some thought.
