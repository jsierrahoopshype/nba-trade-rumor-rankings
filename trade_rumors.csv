Anthony Davis,anthony_davis,2025-11-24,"The Dallas Mavericks are reportedly facing a conundrum when it comes to potentially trading star big man Anthony Davis. During Monday's episode of The Hoop Collective, ESPN's Tim Bontemps explained that Davis' trade value isn't as high as many would expect for a player of his caliber. ""The idea of trading Anthony Davis has everyone trained to think, well, they're gonna get three firsts, two swaps, they're gonna get two young players and they're gonna get all this stuff,"" Bontemps said around the 33:00 mark. <a class=""quote"" href=""https://bleacherreport.com/articles/25304382-what-anthony-davis-trade-value-nba-insiders-shocking-revelation-amid-mavs-rumors"" onclick=""return HHRumors.OpenLink(this,'g68Y-rKG8X');"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Read more on Bleacher Report"">""I shouldn't say it's not gonna happen... but, you talk to people in the league, there's not a lot of teams that are lining up to take on a 35-year-old Anthony Davis making $63 million, and you have to assume that he's gonna opt into that deal.""</a> <a class=""rumormedia"" href=""https://bleacherreport.com/articles/25304382-what-anthony-davis-trade-value-nba-insiders-shocking-revelation-amid-mavs-rumors"" onclick=""return HHRumors.OpenLink(this,'g68Y-rKG8X');"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Read more on Bleacher Report"">Bleacher Report</a>",https://bleacherreport.com/articles/25304382-what-anthony-davis-trade-value-nba-insiders-shocking-revelation-amid-mavs-rumors

They don’t want to trade him</a>. There was a report this week from my pal in Houston, Kelly Iko, writing for Yahoo Sports. Kelly wrote that Ball is open to a trade, and that the Hornets are disillusioned with him on various levels. Both parties have come out and publicly denied that — insisting it’s not the case. Again, we haven’t even gotten to Thanksgiving. Trade season doesn’t officially start until December 15th. As of where we are right now, the Hornets insist they’re not gauging Ball’s trade value.” <a class=""rumormedia"" href=""https://www.youtube.com/live/FLwniS558nA"" onclick=""return HHRumors.OpenLink(this,'g68Y-rKG81');"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Read more on YouTube"">YouTube</a>",https://www.youtube.com/live/FLwniS558nA
