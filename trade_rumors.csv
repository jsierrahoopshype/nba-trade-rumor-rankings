Kidd is in good standing in Dallas, both with ownership—which has extended him twice—and a fan base that remembers how Kidd helped deliver a championship as a player and steer the team to the Finals as a coach. His hands are (publicly, at least) clean in the Dončić deal—Harrison gave him cover when he said he didn’t inform Kidd of the trade until it was completed—and no one is pointing fingers his way for the flop of the Mavs’ injury-riddled roster. Under a Kidd regime, Dirk Nowitzki could be brought back into the fold. Will Kidd want the job? Probably, people who know Kidd say. Kidd has craved input in personnel decisions at previous stops.
