Anthony Davis,anthony-davis,2025-11-24T00:00:00,"The Dallas Mavericks are reportedly facing a conundrum when it comes to potentially trading star big man Anthony Davis. During Monday's episode of The Hoop Collective, ESPN's Tim Bontemps explained that Davis' trade value isn't as high as many would expect for a player of his caliber. ""The idea of trading Anthony Davis has everyone trained to think, well, they're gonna get three firsts, two swaps, they're gonna get two young players and they're gonna get all this stuff,"" Bontemps said around the 33:00 mark. ""I shouldn't say it's not gonna happen... but, you talk to people in the league, there's not a lot of teams that are lining up to take on a 35-year-old Anthony Davis making $63 million, and you have to assume that he's gonna opt into that deal.""

To this point — and this will sound a lot like the Ja Morant situation in Memphis — the messaging is that the Hornets don’t want to field those pitches. They don’t want to trade him . There was a report this week from my pal in Houston, Kelly Iko, writing for Yahoo Sports. Kelly wrote that Ball is open to a trade, and that the Hornets are disillusioned with him on various levels. Both parties have come out and publicly denied that — insisting it’s not the case. Again, we haven’t even gotten to Thanksgiving. Trade season doesn’t officially start until December 15th.

It's somewhat reminiscent of the situation Anthony Davis faces in Dallas.

League sources say that the Nuggets and Valančiūnas have mutually agreed to move the guarantee date on his 2026-27 salary from June 29 to July 8. The switch will give Denver some greater optionality to potentially use Valančiūnas' salary in an offseason trade as opposed to deciding on next season before free agency begins at 6 PM ET on June 30 . The 33-year-old will likewise be eligible for an extension with the Nuggets after this season plays out if he decides he's willing to stick around the NBA a little longer. Yet the later guarantee date means Valančiūnas can’t become a free agent until after the league's annual moratorium during the first week of free agency is lifted. marcstein.substack.com,https://marcstein.substack.com/

Ja Morant,ja-morant,2025-11-03T00:00:00,"Tim MacMahon: “This is a team suspension, not the league. That’s a sign his act is wearing thin in Memphis. People will say, 'Oh, it’s just one game.' No — this tells you there’s been years of buildup. This comes after a summer where there were no talks of extending Ja, unlike Jaren Jackson Jr. who got his extension immediately. This organization that once refused to hold Ja accountable is finally saying, ‘Enough.’ And maybe it's not a point of no return, but it sure feels close. They’re clearly re-aligning around Jaren. At this point, you have to ask: how many more chances does he get before it’s time to move on?” YouTube",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxk0-g_WXdM
Ja Morant,ja-morant,2025-11-03T00:00:00,The inevitable talk of rival teams now monitoring the situation is a no-duh way to describe the sudden vibe in Memphis — since rival teams are always poised to pounce on proven All-Stars who might (or might not) be unhappy in their current surroundings — but the truth is that Morant's future has been must-monitor going back to the June draft and the buildup to it. That is when rumbles started to circulate in earnest that the contract extension Morant was eligible for this past offseason would not be offered … and that this team might no longer revolve around him . marcstein.substack.com,https://marcstein.substack.com/p/sunday-best-major-changes-coming
Ja Morant,ja-morant,2025-11-03T00:00:00,"Sure, optimists will insist this isn’t the start of a breakup, but even they’d have to admit the Morant–Memphis relationship doesn’t look as stable as before. And in the NBA, even a hint of friction gets attention fast.

Anthony Davis,anthony-davis,2025-10-31T00:00:00,"Q. How long did you have this information before you tweeted it? Shams Charania: Seven minutes. Five different sources. First heads up: Markieff Morris is being traded to the Lakers. Second heads up: Maxi Klber is being traded to the Lakers. I'm like, what is what is going on? Then I get another source. Three-team deal. Lakers, Mavs, Jazz. Jalen Hood-Schifino is going to Utah. I'm like, what is this three-team deal? These are a bunch of, you know, guys that are on contracts that are like, are they just trading small salaries for small salaries? And then the fourth person tells me Luka Doncic for Anthony Davis, these are all the parts. The whole deal. I got the whole deal. And I'm like, am I being catfished right now? I got to call this person. Call them. Hear their voice. It's real. I'm like, holy… And like my hands are literally shaking. I'm like sweating. Mind you, the context of this, it's like 11 central time. I'm in Chicago. The Lakers had just beaten the Knicks by a lot in New York at the Garden on a Saturday night. My hair was all down. I had my glasses on. I was getting ready to shut it down for the night. And I'm just like my hands are trembling. Like I'm just like this is unbelievable. I called the fifth person. Actually, I called someone else. The phone didn't even ring. Wouldn't even go. So I'm like, ‘This person is definitely dealing with this right now.’ I call another person. The person picks up. I'm like, ‘There's no way this sh*t is f*cking real."" And the person goes, ‘Yeah, it's f*cking real.’ Next thing you know, that's that. Seven minutes.

LeBron James,lebron-james,2025-10-31T00:00:00,"Shams Charania: We still don't know where LeBron James is going to be. Is he going to finish his career with the Lakers, or is he going to be somewhere else? I think it's very much up in the air. Q. Do you think he would change teams? Charania: I'm not sure that he knows exactly how the end is going to play out. Could it be with the Lakers? Sure. But he's a free agent at the end of the season. So, if he's going to continue to play, there's clearly a chance he's somewhere else potentially. But again, he could stay with the Lakers .

Terry Rozier,terry-rozier,2025-10-30T00:00:00,"Barry Jackson: So, to recap, the 7 ways Heat have been wronged so far: 1). NBA, in approving Rozier trade, did not tell Heat about ongoing feds investigation of Rozier. 2) Charlotte did not tell the Heat. 3) Miami must continue paying Rozier salary (not to Terry, but into interest bearing account). 4). Heat, so far, has been given no cap relief to replace him and continues with 13 players, minus injured guys (so 9 or 10 tonight). 5). Per Windy, Heat cannot use Rozier as salary cap ballast in trade. 6). Heat has not been given draft pick back (at this point), meaning next 4 1st rounders are frozen for trade purposes. 7). NBA hasn't voided Rozier deal (unlike Jontay Porter, who was voided by NBA before federal charges), meaning Heat has no room under tax line to sign replacement. x.com",https://x.com/flasportsbuzz/status/1983917321279201566
Terry Rozier,terry-rozier,2025-10-30T00:00:00,Barry Jackson: Another way Heat is being wronged: Windy said yesterday he doesn't expect NBA will allow Heat to use Rozier as salary facilitator in trade. His salary (purely for cap rules) would be helpful if high salary player asks out from another team x.com,https://x.com/flasportsbuzz/status/1983924745226641424
Terry Rozier,terry-rozier,2025-10-30T00:00:00,"Barry Jackson: So @PabloTorre quotes NBA source with this:“Terry’s investigation was never closed, so he was not cleared of anything...It is true we did not find a violation of our rules, but we did not close our investigation.”(Makes it all the more outrageous that Heat wasn't told pre-trade) x.com",https://x.com/flasportsbuzz/status/1983889536028700812
