2025-11-11,Anthony Davis,,espn.com,"It's uncertain what the trade market for Anthony Davis would be due to his durability issues, although he is still a dominant force on both ends of the floor when healthy. Several league sources were adamant that determining that market over the upcoming months is due diligence that Dallas should do as it's become clear that Harrison's hopes of a three- to four-year window of contention won't come to fruition . ""You don't go two timelines anymore,"" a West executive said. ""You say, 'We're going to take what we can get [for Davis].' At this point, I'm not sure what they can get.""

""They're testing the waters a little bit. I don't get the sense that there's anything real close,"" he clarified.

2025-11-10,Karl-Anthony Towns,,dunkingwithwolves.com,"Even still, some people (not necessarily Wolves fans) are wondering if Randle could be traded again, given Minnesota's need for a point guard and surplus of frontcourt players. Recently, to the delight of Wolves fans, trusted NBA insider Jake Fischer shut down these rumors. ""They [Minnesota] also really value Julius Randle being a secondary playmaker/creator next to Ant, taking some of the pressure off him as a primary ball-handler, Fischer said. That was something that they valued in that trade that sent Karl-Anthony Towns to the Knicks. I really don't see them looking to trade Randle at all.""

2025-11-09,Amen Thompson,,nbcsports.com,"As written about this week at NBC Sports, league sources have told us there is not much of a trade market for Morant right now, and any offers for him at this point would be lowball ones looking for a steal. Minnesota and Sacramento are reportedly interested, not Houston (why take the ball out of the hands of Amen Thompson and Kevin Durant? The Rockets need a floor general at the point). Memphis is in a tough spot because Morant is still a player people pay to see in a small market, and the business side of the equation matters, as Tim Bontemps mentions at ESPN.

2025-11-08,Lamelo Ball,,espn.com,"All of it, though, begins with Ball, an extraordinary talent who has people around the league questioning whether the sum will ever equal the many intriguing parts: a 6-7 frame, deep shooting range and incredible playmaking vision and open floor ability. ""He still doesn't know who he is,"" a Western Conference scout said. ""But I think you can justify buying into the talent."" That is why trying to come up with a proper gauge of Ball's trade value is nearly impossible. He has played in just 58.1% of Charlotte's games since being drafted No. 3 in 2020, and outside of one blowout loss in a play-in game, the Hornets haven't sniffed the playoffs. ""Yes, he's talented, but he doesn't take basketball seriously enough,"" another West scout said. ""It's hard to build a winner with him because of how he plays, and the liberties he takes for himself when he plays. ""Would someone take a flier on him? For sure. But Charlotte isn't taking a flier price for him.""
